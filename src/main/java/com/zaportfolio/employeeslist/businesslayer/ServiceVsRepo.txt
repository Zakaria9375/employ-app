The main difference between
        the EmployeeService interface and its implementation
        and the EmployeeRepository interface lies in
                their respective ...responsibilities... and
                                 ...purposes... within the application.

    EmployeeRepository Interface:
        Responsibility:
            The EmployeeRepository interface is responsible for data access and persistence.
            It provides an abstraction over the underlying database or data storage system.
        Purpose:
            is to define methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee entities.
            It handles the low-level database interactions and
            provides a clean and consistent API for accessing and manipulating employee data.

    EmployeeService Interface and EmployeeServiceImpl Implementation:
        Responsibility:
            responsible for implementing the business logic and coordinating the operations related to employee entities.
        Purpose:
            is to define a contract for the business logic and operations specific to employees.
            It provides a higher-level abstraction that encapsulates the operations related to
                employees, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting employee records.
                provides the actual implementation of the business logic defined in the interface.
                It handles the coordination between
                        the presentation layer (e.g., REST controllers) and
                        the data access layer (e.g., repositories)
                            for performing the required operations on employee entities.
