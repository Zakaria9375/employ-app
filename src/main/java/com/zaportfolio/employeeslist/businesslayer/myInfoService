The main role of the EmployeeService interface and its implementation are:

    Abstraction of Business Logic:
        The EmployeeService interface defines the contract for handling business logic related to employee operations.
        It encapsulates the operations that can be performed on employee entities and
        provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with the underlying repository.

    CRUD Operations:
        The EmployeeService interface declares methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employees.
        These methods define the necessary functionality to
            create new employees, retrieve employee details, update employee information, and delete employees from the system.

    Transaction Management:
        The EmployeeService interface and its implementation can handle transaction management.
        By applying appropriate annotations (such as @Transactional),
            the service methods can participate in database transactions,
            ensuring that multiple operations related to employee entities are executed as a single atomic unit.


    Error Handling and Exception Propagation:
        The EmployeeService interface provides a central location to
            handle exceptions and propagate meaningful error messages to the calling code.
        allows you to handle specific exceptions, perform logging, and transform exceptions into appropriate error responses.

    Dependency Injection:
        The EmployeeServiceImpl class typically utilizes dependency injection to
            inject the EmployeeRepository or other required dependencies.
        This enables loose coupling and enhances testability and maintainability.

    Integration with other Layers:
        The EmployeeService interface serves as a bridge between
            the presentation layer (such as REST controllers) and
            the data access layer (such as repositories).
        It receives requests from the presentation layer,
        processes them using business logic, and
         interacts with the repository layer for data persistence or retrieval.
